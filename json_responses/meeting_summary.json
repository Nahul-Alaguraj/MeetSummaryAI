Ideas were proposed to address this, such as hosting a pancake breakfast to encourage attendance. Additionally, the group discussed the increasing number of sick students and decided to post health tips to prevent the spread of illness. A specific student, John Smith, was highlighted for missing seven days of school, and it was suggested he speak with the guidance counselor. The group also plans to help John's family by finding free or low-cost childcare resources.",
